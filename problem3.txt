Problem 3

Analysis:
	input: a string
	output: a string
	error conditions: none
	
Program:
initialize strings word1, word2, word3, newSentence
initialize variables spaceIndex = 0, lastIndex = 0

input string into variable sentence
spaceIndex = the index of the first space in sentence
word1 = substring of sentence from 0 to spaceIndex
newSentence = substring of sentence from (spaceIndex + 1) to (length of sentence)
spaceIndex = the index of the first space in newSentence
word2 = substring of newSentence from 0 to spaceIndex
word2 = word2 + " "
newSentence = substring of newSentence from (spaceIndex + 1) to (length of newSentence)
word3 = newSentence
word3 = word3 + " "
newSentence = word3 + word2 + word1
print newSentence

Test data: any three word string
